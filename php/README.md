# PHP Code Samples for O\*NET Web Services

`batch_coder.php` is a non-interactive command-line program which codes a JSON file of job titles to O*NET-SOC occupations.

`keyword_search.php` is an interactive command-line program which demonstrates the occupation keyword search.

`OnetWebService.php` is a utility class you may use in your own applications.

## Running the example

Clone the sample code repository:

    git clone https://github.com/onetcenter/web-services-v2-samples

Change to the PHP directory:

    cd web-services-v2-samples/php

### Interactive keyword search example

Run the keyword search example:

    php keyword_search.php

Follow the prompts to enter your O*NET Web Services API Key, and your search terms.

### Batch coding example

Make a copy of the file `batch_coder_sample_input.json`, and add your O*NET Web Services API Key. For more information on the file format, see the [batch coder documentation](batch_coder_README.md).

Run the batch coder example with your edited copy of the sample input:

    php batch_coder.php < batch_coder_input_copy.json > batch_coder_output.json
    
The file `batch_coder_output.json` will contain the results.
